# MSTU 5003 Design Document

Write a design document where you explain your project. You should clearly explain the problem you're trying to solve. Be sure to describe the domain you're working with and the users you're trying to target. Remember that the point of your design document is that you can hand it off to any developer and theoretically they would be able to understand and build the program.

You'll be adding to your design document as you work towards your midterm due on **March 22, 2017**.


## Topic
*What is the subject at hand?*
*Which broader field(s) does this site apply to?*

This site is intended to teach college students how to drive large, 12-passenger vans. Driving is a skill that is taught through practice of both safety and driving skills. As a teenager, a majority of 16 and 17 year olds learn how to drive a standard 4-door sedan or SUV, with about 5 passengers total. Some larger SUVS may have room for 7 passengers. This site works with drivers who already have experience driving smaller vehicles and are ready to make the shift to driving larger, 12-passenger vans.

Driving a large van is quite different from your mom's mini-van or your sports car. As Car Rental express explains, "The first time driving a van for anyone is a different experience.  Vans don't handle like a sports car, or even a midsize sedan. Your van rental will be longer, taller, and have different sight lines than the average vehicle. This doesn't mean however, that you need to be afraid of driving or reserving an independent van rental, it just means you need to know a few things about how to drive a van before you climb behind the wheel" (https://www.carrentalexpress.com/blog/how-safely-drive-van-rental).



## Problem
*What is the problem you're trying to solve?*
The problem that my website is addressing and solve is how to effectively and safely transition driving skills of a small car or SUV, to driving a large 12-passenger van. AAA explains, "The vehicle design of 15 passenger vans requires drivers and passengers to be aware of some unique limitations and techniques regarding the operation, handling and packing that will help ensure a safe trip" (http://exchange.aaa.com/safety/roadway-safety/passenger-van-safety/#.WOVozo61uT8).

"

When I went to college, I was required to drive a large van from the suburbs of Philadelphia, to the narrow streets of West Philly after enrolling in a tutoring volunteer program. I had absolutely no training or guide on how to drive a van, but because I was the leader of the volunteer group, I was in charge of safely transporting 11 other undergraduates 30 miles. For my entire time as a driver, I had only two years as a driver, accustomed to driving a small, five passenger sedan. Mansfield University explains, "15-passenger vans have an increased rollover risk under certain conditions.
 The risk of rollover increases dramatically as the number of occupants increases from fewer than five occupants to over ten passengers.
 15-passenger vans (with 10 or more occupants) had a rollover rate in single vehicle crashes that is nearly 5 times the rate of those that were lightly loaded" (www.mansfield.edu/environmental-health-safety/.../15PassengerVanWebTraining.pdf). This is information I wish I had before I had stepped into the 12-passenger van.

On my first day of driving the van, I had 11 freshman in the back seat, as I drove it into Center City Philadelphia. I was used to driving a small sports car and had no experience with driving such a large vehicle. Since Villanova University had no training, I had no knowledge going into the experience. On the very first day of driving this van, I ended up lightly side-swiping a mini-van, because it was hard to see using the mirrors. As Mansfield University continues, "It is important that the van be operated by experienced drivers. They should understand and be familiar with the handling characteristics of their vans, especially when fully loaded."

With a site like this, drivers who are in similar situations as I was will be able to gain valuable information about how to drive a van, which is different from traditional sedans. It will provide them comfort and knowledge as their driving skills transition from sedans to cars.

## Target Audience
*Who is your target audience? Describe in detail*
The target audience for the website is college or graduate students (ages 18-26), who have prior driving experience with smaller vehicles, but who are looking to transition into larger 12-passenger vehicles specifically. This is not a website for users who wish to drive SUVS, this is a site specifically for drivers who have 3-5 years of driving experience, who wish to now operate effectively and safely a 12-passenger van.

### User Stories
**Outline 2-3 user stories. Describe how they find out, engage and come back to your site. Provide rationale.**

Structure your user stories as features, so you can actually build it to meet the users needs.

**Example**: As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

Keep these questions in mind:
- Who are you building the feature for? What type of user?
- What are you building and what will it accomplish?
- What kind of engagement and value will the feature/website bring for the user? What does it accomplish?

- **User Story 1:** As a college freshman, I want to drive my University's van to and from football games as part of a work-study program. I don't have much experience other than driving my mom's car to and from high school. I've only been driving for six months and while I love driving, I am not quite comfortable driving this van. With some help from a website, I would like to do some research to gain some confidence on how to care and drive a van so I can earn my work-study wages.
- **User Story 2:** As a senior at Boston College, I have to drive a van of freshman to Boston each Monday and Tuesday to tutor at a Title I school. I have only driven a 12-passenger van twice and got into an accident. I am extremely nervous to drive the van again, but believe if I get some basic virtual training and knowledge on how to better prepare myself, I can become a Successful driver.
- **User Story 3:** I am a senior high school student and the manager of the varsity baseball team. I am required to drive a 12-passenger van to and from the games, carrying the equipment (water jugs, bats, balls, helmets, etc..) and the coaching staff. I drive my Nissan Pathfinder each day and have extensive experience driving trucks, as my part time job is working at a construction site. I would like to brush up on my driving skills for large vans.



## Strategy

This section should describe objectives, goals and metrics.

The Learning Objective: Intermediate level drivers can acquire the knowledge necessary to drive a 12-passenger van safely and effectively.

Goals:
1. To learn about the design of a 12-passenger van
2. To learn how to maintain and care for the van (fuel, engine, tires)
3. How to operate the van in poor weather (rain and snow)
4. How to operate the 12-passenger van (mechanical)

The goal of this site is to provide resources for experienced drivers to learn how to safely drive and take care of a van. This will assess this prior knowledge through a pre-assessment and then link them to relevant articles, videos, and facts about the 12-passenger van.

This site will act as a hub for drivers to build their knowledge and confidence with the 12-passenger van.

### Site Objectives:
*What do we want to get out of the site?*
Users will get the knowledge, skills, background, and safety risks of driving a 12-passenger van. They will be linked to a site that compares and contrasts a standard 4-door car to a van, seeing the differences in terms of engine, fueling, weight adjustments, care-care, etc...

### Success Metrics
*Outline how you will check that the goals for your site have been met*
I will check that the goals for my site has been met by evaluating the credibility of the resources the site out sources to users, the data from the pre and post assessments, and  user feedback.

Make sure your program does something to measure the consider assessments as a part of your program. Here are a couple.

My website will have a pre-assessment to first gather how much knowledge a user has on operating the van. That data will be stored so it can be compared to their final assessment.

The site will then a unit for each of the learning goals:
Goals:
1. To learn about the design of a 12-passenger van
2. To learn how to maintain and care for the van (fuel, engine, tires)
3. How to operate the van in poor weather (rain and snow)
4. How to operate the 12-passenger van (mechanical)

In order to get through each learning goal, users must pass the interim quizzes which are composed of a video lesson and a 10 question quiz. Passing is 75 or above.

The final assessment is only accessible if a student has passed all of the four interim quizzes with a 75% or higher.

The final assessment will consist of 50 questions.

At the end of the assessment, students will be able to compare their pre-assessment scores to their final assessment. There will also be a reflection log, where users can reflect on whether or not they feel ready to operate the 12-passenger van. They will then score themselves 1-10 (1 being the least comfortable and 10 being the most comfortable). If a student selects 6 or below, they will be redirected to various outside resources for learning how to drive the van.

Examples of outside resources:

## Scope
Functional and Content Specifications

The content of this site is first developed my content experts. Then, with permission from outside resources, if students still feel they need additional resources they are linked to outside sources.

## Structure
Interaction design and information architecture

The main interaction of this site is through the quizzes, assessments, and the reflection section of the website.

Reflection is such a large part of the learning process. This site is not intended to tell whether or not a driver is ready to operate the van, rather its purpose to allow the user to reflect on how comfortable he or she is to operate the vehicle.
